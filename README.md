# Desktop Niko
Niko is a playable character from the game OneShot, but now he will be right on your screen!
The Steam version of the 2024 "The World Machine Edition" was used as the basis, as can be seen in the application settings.

## Features
- Meow sound on click (There are currently 5 variants available)
- Clicks and CPS counter
- Don't click too often! It will scare Niko! (This can be disabled by turning on the "peaceful" mode.)
- Setting up facepicks for each state (default, speak, scared, scared speack)
- "Gaming" mode that forces you to ignore clicks (clicks passing through the window are planned, but so far I do not know how to implement this)
- Icon in the system tray
- Simple Discord RPC which shows the time since the last click

## Plans for futere
- Make more facepicks variants, meow sounds and maybe accesories support
- Maybe some idle animations
- I'd like to make some games related to Niko and his love of pancakes, but I'm not sure if it's necessary.

# Editing and Compiling
To create and export the project, I used Godot Engine 4.4.1 to simplify creation and expansion, I did not use any additional plugins, so in theory it should be easy to compile.
It's probably wrong to use Godot for such purposes, but I tried to maximize performance.

## I was in no way involved in the creation of the original game and am not a member of the OneShot development team, this project is purely a fan project.
Almost all the sprites and sounds were taken from the original game and were not created by me.
