Niko is a playable character from the game OneShot, but now they will be right on your screen!
The Steam version of the 2024 "The World Machine Edition" was used as the basis, as can be seen in the application settings.

## Features
- Meow sound on click (There are currently 8 variants available)
- Clicks and CPS counter
- Events
- Achievements
- Don't click too often! It will scare Niko! (This can be disabled by turning on the "peaceful" mode.)

- Setting up facepicks for each state (default, speak, scared, scared speak)
- "Gaming" mode that forces Niko to passthrough clicks
- Icon in the system tray
- 9 Themes from original game(Rainbow theme was not added due to technical reasons.)

## Plans for future
- Make more facepicks variants, maybe accesories support
- Maybe some idle animations
- I'd like to make some games related to Niko and their love of pancakes, but I'm not sure if it's necessary.

# Editing and Exporting
To create and export the project, I used Godot Engine Mono 4.6.1 to simplify creation and expansion.
It's probably wrong to use Godot for such purposes, but I tried to maximize performance.
- Download and install [Godot Mono 4.6.1](https://godotengine.org/)
- Download and install [DotNet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Download the project in any convenient way
- Open Godot and import the project
- Done, you can edit, run and export Desktop Niko into executable

## I was in no way involved in the creation of the original game and am not a member of the OneShot development team, this project is purely a fan project.
Almost all the sprites and sounds were taken from the original game and were not created by me.
