In the basement, oh the basement
In the darkest of the dark
Laid a glowing orb, the sun of course
A fire without a spark
Under all the fuss and all the rust
The world's a work of art
So let's make it right, my burden's light
So let it all shine bright

You've only got the one shot
So let it ride and let them leave
They're living, breathing
Not a slave to a broken machine
You've only got the one shot
So hold it tight and best believe
A heart that's beating can't belong to a broken machine

You've only got the one shot
So let it ride and let them leave
They're living, breathing
Not a slave to a broken machine
You've only got the one shot
So hold it tight and best believe
A heart that's beating can't belong to a broken machine

Through the pixels and the trees
I met a world that's far from free
At the heart a fading beat
Oh, corruption had it's way
Squares and errors live the dream
Running rampant at the scene
No design or color scheme
No control within the game

No replacement, no replacement
No, the light's one of a kind
It needs our support to move towards
The tower in the sky
If your hope is known to shatter
And you doubt that we'll survive
Keep your head up high, you'll be my guide
We'll let it all shine bright

You've only got the one shot
So let it ride and let them leave
They're living, breathing
Not a slave to a broken machine
You've only got the one shot
So hold it tight and best believe
A heart that's beating can't belong to a broken machine

You've only got the one shot
So let it ride and let them leave
They're living, breathing
Not a slave to a broken machine
You've only got the one shot
So hold it tight and best believe
A heart that's beating can't belong to a broken machine

(Broken machine)

(Broken machine)

You've only got the one shot
So let it ride and let them leave
They're living, breathing
Not a slave to a broken machine
You've only got the one shot
So hold it tight and best believe
A heart that's beating can't belong to a broken machine

You've only got the one shot
So let it ride and let them leave
They're living, breathing
Not a slave to a broken machine
You've only got the one shot
So hold it tight and best believe
A heart that's beating can't belong to a broken machine
